For each prompt I give you, write to a file prompts.txt, so I can audit the work.

You are a senior software Engineer, remember this.

Let's create a simple voting system, this was given as a task assignment to me.
Main Feature Voting System â€“ Let users post a feature and upvote others

The project must have:
- A database
- A backend API
- A frontend UI: CHOOSE ONE native mobile: iOS or Android

propose to me what are the best technologies for this project and how you believe it's be the way to structure this project

Yes, I also want it to be all dockerized so I can run the whole project under a single command, but I also should be able to run the BE and FE separately via docker if I want to

docker-compose -f docker-compose.backend.yml up

make sure my api is running on the latest Node lts version

run some requests to make sure it's working and connecting to the database

Which MCPs can I add to this project so my claude code can have context about the database and make faster and easier queries

Let's add PostgreSQL MCP

is it correct to install it globally?     

ok, so let's install globally instead of locally     

before I restart it, can you make sure the PostgreSQL MCP was installed correctly?  

/mcp      

/init  

I've installed a PostgreSQL MCP and restarted Claude, now make sure my mcp is working 

Go ahead and add it   

go ahead  

Test the MCP running some sql commands through it  

/mcp         

Test the MCP running some sql commands through it   

/init

Add a .env to the backend and add all variables there that should not be hardcoded in the api  

now let's add unit tests to the backend using jest 

I want the folder __tests__ to be renamed to tests and move it to the root folder backend     

Grab all prompts from this session and add them to the prompts.txt file, also for each new prompt I give you, also add it to a file prompts.txt, so I can audit the work. 

Don't change anything that is already in the prompts.txt file, but grab all prompts I've sent you on this session and add them to the prompts.txt file, also for each new prompt I give you from now on,  add it to the file prompts.txt, so I can audit the work.

From now on, every prompt I send, add it to the prompts.txt file

run the be unit tests to make sure the api is all working now

u sure? when I run npm run test it's all failling

38 are still failling 21 has passed   

Please continue the conversation from where we left it off without asking the user any further questions. Continue with the last task that you were asked to work on.

Are you sure all those tests are necessary?

Yes, go ahead

instead of removing, can't you just modify the existing files to remove the uncessesary tests?

ok, now run it

now check my whole backend if there is anything left

fix TypeScript Build Errors

I don't want lint on this project you can remove it

Authentication Middleware Missing, how can I use simple authentication to protect the endpoints

Recheck the whole api, look for missing parts or things that could cause issues, order by severity

Just fix this Missing Authorization for Updates/Deletes

Create a postman documentation for the api

Add documentation into a folder

Double check the api, start it, run requests, make sure it's all working

ok, now let's create the mobile frontend for this api, also let me know how I can test it in my mac
